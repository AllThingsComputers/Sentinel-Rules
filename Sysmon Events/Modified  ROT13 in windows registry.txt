 // Description of the Detection:  UserAssist tracks applications that were executed by a user and encodes data using the ROT13 cipher. Because Gamarue is often installed by a user clicking an LNK file, if you're trying to figure out the source of Gamarue, check out the registry key HKEY_USERS\{SID}\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist for any registry modifications ending in .yax-.yax is the ROT13 encoded value of .Ink.
