// Title of Detection:  Telnet.exe attempting Unexpected Ports
// Authorship & Contact: https://allthingscomputers.medium.com  https://twitter.com/allthingshandle  https://allthingscomputersblog.wordpress.com/ 
 // Description of the Detection:  Adversaries may communicate using a protocol and port pairing that are typically not associated. For example,  https over port 8088(Citation: Symantec Elfin Mar 2019) or port 587(Citation: Fortinet Agent Tesla April 2018) as opposed to the traditional port 443. Living off the Land tool they can utilise Telnet. The syntax it matches is telnet 192.168.105.10 80. It can ping ICMP domain, pc name or IP.  negative look forwards are not supported in KQLâ€™s regex so this is  written the long way.
