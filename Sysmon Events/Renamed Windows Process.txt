// Description of the Detection: an adversary may rename a Windows Process to Stage Data Theft using Scripting Utilities. this is done by seeing when the same process has multiple hashes suggest one is masquerading 
// References (if available): 
// The Logic of the Detection or Query Begins Below This Line
let processNameWithTwoHashes = 
Sysmon
| where EventID == 1
| summarize dcount(hash_imphash) by tostring(Image)//alternate is /tostring(OriginalFileName)
| where dcount_hash_imphash >= 2;
Sysmon 
| where CommandLine matches regex "(?i)(-r |-rename|-Ren|Rename-Item|rename)" and CommandLine has_any (processNameWithTwoHashes)  //  this will detect when an process name with at least two unique IMP hashes has had at least 1 renamed
