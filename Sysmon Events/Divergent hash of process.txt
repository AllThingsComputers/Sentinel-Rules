// Title of Detection:  Divergent hash of process
// Authorship & Contact: https://allthingscomputers.medium.com  https://twitter.com/allthingshandle  https://allthingscomputersblog.wordpress.com/ 
// Description of the Detection:  could be new malware or just safe software but an updated version.   this should deliver the same process name but with multiple hashes for example for example this is to detect when adversary renames a malicious binary to one of a built-in/common windows process to 1
// References (if available): 
// The Logic of the Detection or Query Begins Below This Line
