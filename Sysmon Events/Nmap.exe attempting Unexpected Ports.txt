// Description of the Detection:  Adversaries may communicate using a protocol and port pairing that are typically not associated. For example,  https over port 8088(Citation: Symantec Elfin Mar 2019) or port 587(Citation: Fortinet Agent Tesla April 2018) as opposed to the traditional port 443. Living off the Land they can utilise the tool nmap . format it matches will be  nmap -p 1-200 <IP_address> can ping ICMP domain, pc name or IP.  negative look forwards are not supported in KQLâ€™s regex so this is  written the long way.
