// Description of the Detection:  Adversaries may enumerate files and directories or may search in specific locations of a host or network share for certain information within a file system. Adversaries may use the information from [File and Directory Discovery] during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviours, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.
