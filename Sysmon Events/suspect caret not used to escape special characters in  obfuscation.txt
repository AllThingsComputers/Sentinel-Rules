// Title of Detection: suspect caret not used to escape special characters in  obfuscation
// Authorship & Contact: https://allthingscomputers.medium.com  https://twitter.com/allthingshandle  https://allthingscomputersblog.wordpress.com/ 
 // Description of the Detection:  In the Windows Command Shell, the caret (^) character is an escape character. When it precedes special characters, like the pipe (|) character or file redirection operators (<>), those special characters will be treated as normal characters. When the caret symbol precedes non-special characters, nothing special happens; it is effectively ignored.
