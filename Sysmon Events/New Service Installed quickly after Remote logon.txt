// Description: Detects new services installed shortly after a remote logon, a tactic commonly used by attackers to establish persistence.

// The Logic of the Detection:
let connectionEvent = Sysmon
| where EventID == 3 // Network connection event
| where Image endswith "\\services.exe" // Looking for connections involving services.exe
| where toint(SourceIp) != toint(DestinationIp) // Remote logon
| where SourcePort >= 49152 and DestinationPort >= 49152 // Dynamic port range
| where isnotempty(SourceIp) and isnotempty(DestinationIp) // Ensure both IPs are populated
| extend ConnectionAllowedTime = TimeGenerated; // Capture the time of the connection

let regkeyEvent = Sysmon
| where EventID == 13 // Registry key event
| where TargetObject contains "HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\services"; // Looking for changes in services registry keys

connectionEvent
| join kind=inner (regkeyEvent) on Computer
| where datetime_diff('minute', TimeGenerated, ConnectionAllowedTime) <= 2 // Service installation within 2 minutes after remote connection
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, SourceIp, DestinationIp, SourcePort, DestinationPort, TargetObject, CommandLine // Output relevant information for further investigation
