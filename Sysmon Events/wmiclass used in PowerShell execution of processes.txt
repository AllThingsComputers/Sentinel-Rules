// Title of Detection: wmiclass used in PowerShell execution of processes
// Authorship & Contact: https://allthingscomputers.medium.com  https://twitter.com/allthingshandle  https://allthingscomputersblog.wordpress.com/ 
// Description of the Detection:  In some Emotet campaigns we observed the WMI Provider Host (wmiprvse.exe) spawning PowerShell with an encoded command. After decoding the first layer, we noticed use of the wmiclass .NET class to call the Create method of the Win32_Process class in order to execute the Emotet payload. To detect this behaviour we look for PowerShell processes with a decoded command line containing references to wmiclass and win32_process
