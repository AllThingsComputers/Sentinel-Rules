// Title of Detection:  Sticky Keys Attack 
// Authorship & Contact: https://allthingscomputers.medium.com  https://twitter.com/allthingshandle  https://allthingscomputersblog.wordpress.com/ 
 // Description of the Detection: This variant of the common "Sticky Keys" attack involves replacing the file sethc.exe-an Accessibility Feature native to Windows-with a renamed copy of cmd.exe, the Windows Command Prompt. The masquerading binary is still named "sethc.exe," however, the internal name will now indicate the true identity of the file. SETHC.exe can also be replaced with a copy of explorer.exe (or any other.exe) giving full system level access from the logon screen as well
