 // Description of the Detection:  Regsvr32, web address and scrobj.dll in command line To catch that outlier we could either look for instances of regsvr32 that have the '/i' option passed, or search for the '*.sct' extension in the CLI. I would probably go with the '/i' option. It's likely to be a little more noisy, but if someone used a file with a different extension, we'd still have a good chance of seeing the activity.
