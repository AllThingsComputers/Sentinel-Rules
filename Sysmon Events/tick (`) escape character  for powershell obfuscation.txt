// Title of Detection:   tick (`) escape character  for powershell obfuscation
// Authorship & Contact: https://allthingscomputers.medium.com  https://twitter.com/allthingshandle  https://allthingscomputersblog.wordpress.com/ 
// Description of the Detection:  If one more layer of escape characters is added to the sample command, powershell.exe would throw an error since it does not treat the caret as an escape character like cmd.exe but rather uses the tick character (') for escaping.
