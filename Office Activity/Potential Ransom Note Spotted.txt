// Title of Detection: Potential Ransom Note Spotted
// Authorship & Contact: https://allthingscomputers.medium.com  https://twitter.com/allthingshandle  https://allthingscomputersblog.wordpress.com/ 
// Description of the Detection: Ransomware variants often create a Ransom note in every directory it encrypts. This looks for common file extensions of Ransom notes created or modified in a minimum of 14 unique folders.
// References (if available): 
// The Logic of the Detection or Query Begins Below This Line

// Define common file extensions for ransomware notes
let noteExtensions = dynamic(["DOC", "DOCX", "odt", "rtf", "TXT", "PDF", "HTM", "HTML", "bmp", "jpeg", "jpg", "png", "tif", "tiff"]); // fixed typo for "odt"

// Define file actions we want to monitor for
let fileAction = dynamic(["FileModified", "FileRenamed", "FileUploaded", "FileSyncUploadedFull"]);

// Query Office Activity logs for file actions related to ransom notes
OfficeActivity
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(10m)  // Adjust the time filter to your needs
| where Operation has_any(fileAction) and SourceFileExtension has_any(noteExtensions)
| where Site_Url contains ".sharepoint.com/personal/" and UserId <> "app@sharepoint"  // Exclude system-generated entries
| summarize count() by Site_Url, SourceFileName  // Count occurrences of file names across different directories
| where count_ >= 14  // This threshold can be adjusted based on your environment (e.g., ransomware typically leaves many copies of a ransom note)
