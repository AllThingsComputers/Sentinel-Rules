// Title of Detection: Increase in Microsoft Teams Message Deletion
// Authorship & Contact: https://allthingscomputers.medium.com  https://twitter.com/allthingshandle  https://allthingscomputersblog.wordpress.com/ 
// Description of the Detection: This will trigger when thereâ€™s an uncharacteristic increase in ms teams message deletions against their personal baselines so this may be suspicious removal of message
// References (if available): 
// The Logic of the Detection or Query Begins Below This Line
// setting the variables look back time for deleted messages and the threshold for the baseline and the new deletions
let baselineLookback = 21d;
let baselineToRemoveHistoricHighDeleters = 30;
let recentActivityLookbackTime = 3d;
let recentActivityMinimumDeletes = 8;
// baseline list of users who in the lookback period before have known as big deleters in their behaviours so they are whitelisted as they delete all the time 
let HighMessageDeleters = ( 
OfficeActivity
| where TimeGenerated > ago(baselineLookback) and TimeGenerated < ago(recentActivityLookbackTime)
| where OfficeWorkload =~ "MicrosoftTeams"
| where Operation =~ "MessageDeleted"
| summarize count() by Userld
| where count_> baselineToRemoveHistoricHighDeleters );
//  is a person deletes over the triggering number of messages per day when they don't normally do so it may be worth looking into
 OfficeActivity
| where TimeGenerated > ago(recentActivityLookbackTime)
| where OfficeWorkload =~ "MicrosoftTeams"
| where Operation =~ "MessageDeleted"
// and removal of any people who historically delete a lot 
| where Userld !in (HighMessageDeleters)
