// Title of Detection:    suspect Space character left  after filename
// Authorship & Contact: https://allthingscomputers.medium.com  https://twitter.com/allthingshandle  https://allthingscomputersblog.wordpress.com/ 
 // Description of the Detection:  Monitor for spaces at the end of file names, that can easily be checked with file monitoring. From the users perspective though, this is very hard to notice from within the Finder.app or on the command line in the Terminal.app. Processes executed from binaries containing non-standard extensions in the filename are suspect.
